## Current Project
### _New and improved_ Tooth brush holder!
#### *September 6th, 2020*
*Hey,* so I ordered a 3d printer for prototyping parts for my rocket engine, but who gets a 3d printer *just* to do work with!? and if you **"_do_ only use it for work"** I call bullshit, you play with that thing all the time when nobody is looking. So as is 3d printing tradition I designed something I had absolutely no need for just because I wanted to justify an $800 dollar purchase. *So* naturally I took the most useless object in my house and decided to try and improve it. And of course the object I choose was a toothbrush holder!
